*Detects the undetectable:* **False Negative**
{{< /lead >}}

## False Negative (FN)

A **false negative** happens when a cybersecurity tool misses a real threat. 
It wrongly says a system is safe. 
This is worse than false positives. 
It leaves companies blind to dangers and creates a *false sense of security*..

Here's why **false negatives** matter a lot.
One missed vulnerability can cause big problems like data leaks or ransomware. 

For example, zero-day exploits or misconfigured systems often slip through due to limitations in scanning tools or outdated signatures.
The consequences can be *catastrophic, as attackers exploit these blind spots*.

Sadly, false negatives are common. 
Many rely on automated tools that miss these tricky threats.
Budget constraints, lack of expertise, and overconfidence in tools, has make it wasy to overlook them.


## FN Discovery

**False negatives** are the undetectable threats that lurk in plain sight. 
Ignoring them can be risky to any organization. 

I just released a new tool on GitHub to help uncover false negatives. 
It *detects undetectable threats* that could harm your systems.
