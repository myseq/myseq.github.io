## Summary (My notes)

A series of videos (3 parts) that talk about vulnerability management: 
 - from finding the context with tools
 - leveraging the context for prioritization
 - leveraging context to create meaningful and tailored metrics for specifics to owners, systems, applications, by business unit
    - churn rate 
    - mean time to detect - average
    - mean time to resolve - average
    - agents coverage vs non-agent
    - SLA compliance rate
 - leveraging context for reporting (tailored) automated.
    - exceptions
    - vulnerable images
 - Contextual Information
    - Enterprise assets, cloud assets, and ownership information.
 - Leveraging Contextual Information
    - Prioritization, Metrics, and Reporting
    - Threat intel (internal and external)
 - Effective VulnMgmt
    - Working Vs Effective
      - Mean Time to Detect: Average (vuln pub data - vuln found date)
      - Churn rate: Absolute Value (New vuln - Closed vuln @ monthly)
      - Re-open rate: 
      - Averagee Exposure Windows: Average (vuln close date - vuln pub date)
      - Overdue: (current date - first discovered) > Policy 
    - Communication and collaborations
      - feedback, tailored report
    - Enabling business to deliver mission
 - Comments:
    - CMDB is too slow nowadays
      - tracking image version, usage, life-span, deployed
    - Multiple scanners and automation
