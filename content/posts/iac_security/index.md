## IaC 

[Infrastructure-as-Code](https://myseq.github.io/posts/infrastructure_as_code/) or IaC allows to treat the infrastructure like code.
This means we can define our infrastructure in a plain text file, and use tools to automate the provisioning and management of that infra.

This will save **time and money**, and it can help to ensure the infrastructure **consistency** and is always configured according to policy.

> Typically, we can use `Terraform` (by HashiCorp) or [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) (open source) to write code that defines the infrastructure.  

> This code can then be tracked, versioned and used to provision and manage the entire infrastructure. 

## Benefits

The power of IaC share the same ease and efficiency we have in software development.
It replaces manual configuration with automated scripting, transforming infrastructure into code that can be easily versioned, tracked and deployed.
This brings a wave of benefits to any organization.

With IaC, ***speed*** and ***agility*** become second nature. 
Gone are the days of waiting for manual provisioning. 

IaC automates the entire process, allowing us to spin up new environments or ***scale existing ones in a matter of minutes***. 
This newfound agility empowers you to adapt to changing needs quickly and experiment with new ideas without delay. 

IaC also streamlines disaster recovery, enabling the restore of critical infrastructure in a fraction of the time compared to traditional methods. 
As a result, downtime becomes a distant memory, and every organization can stay ***focused on delivering value***.


## Risks & Challenges

While IaC offers undeniable advantages, it's crucial to acknowledge the potential security risks. 

One key concern is the creation of a **broad attack surface**. 
By codifying infrastructure, IaC can inadvertently expose vulnerabilities within the code itself. 
And malicious actors could exploit these flaws to gain access to critical systems. 

Additionally, IaC often requires storing sensitive data like API keys and **credentials within the code**. If not secured properly, this data becomes a prime target for attackers, potentially leading to breaches and compromised systems.

Furthermore, IaC workflows can introduce the risk of **excessive privilege creep**. 
To function effectively, IaC tools may necessitate elevated access levels. 
If not carefully controlled, these privileges can be misused or accidentally leaked, creating security gaps. 

**Compliance** can also be a challenge.  
Regulations often mandate specific security controls on infrastructure. 
IaC needs to be implemented with these requirements in mind to avoid compliance hurdles. 

Finally, IaC can introduce **friction** into development processes. 
New security protocols and code reviews may be required, potentially slowing down deployments. 

However, by acknowledging these risks and implementing proper mitigation strategies, organizations can leverage the power of IaC while maintaining a secure and compliant environment.


## Best Practices 

> Security is paramount.

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) can offer a powerful and efficient way to manage infrastructure.
Here are a few key **best practices** to build a secure foundation by leveraging its efficiency and unique features:

 1. **Maintain a Detailed Inventory** (Asset Management)

    Keeping track of IaC resources is crucial, just like how we did for physical asset.

    Design and document a standard to **label** all the resources and the ownership properly. 
    This includes implementing a system for identifying, tagging, monitoring, and maintaining an inventory list. 
    
    This becomes especially important as development teams grow, preventing lost resources and simplifying vulnerability scanning.

 1. **Scan Your Templates**  
    
    Templates are the building blocks of IaC automation. 

    Regularly scan these templates using dedicated tools to identify and address potential vulnerabilities before they become security gaps.
     - [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) (AquaSec): *Scans SBOM, CVE, IaC misconfiguration, sensitive info and secrets.* 
     - [TFSec](https://github.com/aquasecurity/tfsec) (AquaSec): *Static analysis of terraform code to spot potential misconfiguration.*
     - [CheckOV](https://www.checkov.io/) (PrismaCloud): *Scans and analyze IaC code for misconfiguration including Terraform, CloudFormation, K8s, Helm, ARM templates and Serverless framework.*
     - [TerraScan](https://github.com/tenable/terrascan) (Tenable): *Static code analyzer for IaC (500+) for misconfiguration, configuration change (drift) monitoring, security vulnerabilities and compliance violation. Can run locally or integrated with CI/CD.* 

 1. **Address Environmental Drift**  

    Over time, infrastructure configurations can drift due to unmonitored changes made by developers.  

    Regularly benchmark assets' configurations to identify and rectify any environmental drift that may introduce security risks. 
    This ensures the infrastructure remains compliant and secure.

 1. **Secure Your Secrets**  
    
    Avoid storing sensitive information or secrets, such as passwords, API keys, and tokens, directly in IaC templates or databases. 

    Instead, leverage a professional secrets management engine, like vault or CSP secrets mgmt, to securely store and manage these critical assets. 
    This eliminates the risk of accidental exposure.

 1. **Enforce Least Privilege and Secure Workflows**  

    While it's tempting to give developers broad access, it's essential to implement **the principle of least privilege**.  

    Use authentication and identity-based rules to ensure developers only have the necessary rights for their tasks. 
    Additionally, establish a workflow and approval process for all IaC changes, adding another layer of security.

By following these best practices, you can leverage the power of IaC while maintaining a secure and compliant infrastructure environment.
