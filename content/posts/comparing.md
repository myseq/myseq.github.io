*Have you ever need to compare 2 large numbers, which is larger?*

**10<sup>36</sup> Vs. 9<sup>37</sup>**
{{< /lead >}}

Which is larger? 10<sup>36</sup> or 9<sup>37</sup>?
And how I compare them.

## Strategy

Here's the strategy: 
***Compare them with 1***.

Just divide them and get the result.
If the result is larger than 1, then A is larger than B.

## My Steps

In this case, I'll assign them as below:

 A = 9<sup>37</sup>

 B = 10<sup>36</sup>

> Instead of `A = 10^36`, I use `A = 9^37` because it is easier to compare.

Let's simplify `A` first:

A = 9<sup>37</sup> = 9<sup>36</sup> * 9

So,

A / B = (9<sup>36</sup> * 9) / (10<sup>36</sup>) = (0.9)<sup>36</sup> * 9

Obviously, the result is ***smaller*** than **1**.

And the conclusion is <u>**10<sup>36</sup> > 9<sup>37</sup>**</u>.
