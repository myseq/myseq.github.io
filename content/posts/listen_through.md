The creator uses readily available materials and explains the science behind how the device works, including how sound waves are captured and converted into an audio signal. 

> This laser microphone can pick up sound from a distance using just a laser and receiver.
> This technology was first used during the Cold War by the KGB and is still used today. 

> By shining a laser beam at a window, sound waves inside the room cause tiny vibrations that modulate the reflected light. 
> Using a photodiode sensor and an amplifier circuit, we can convert those fluctuations into audio.
