## Agile Framework
 
> *The very first common mistake, is thinking that using a framework or agile method automatically makes a company agile.*

Unfortunately, this is something that often happens at management level. 

Very often, `Agile` is being compared (justified) against the `Waterfall` methodology. Back in 2006, that is the first time I heard about `Agile`. It is being tagged as more **flexible**, which allow for a team to pivot and make change much easier. 

However, being more **flexible** does not always lead to being more **productive**. 

> *Do flexible working hours improve productivity?*

Before we dive into the common mistakes and challenges in adopting `Agile`, let me define what Agile means for me.
 - Most of the Agile methodologies (like Scrum, Lean, XP or Kanban) are developed with software development in mind.
 - Agile emphasizes delivering products in small increments. (*Incremental delivery can come with many advantages and disadvantages*)
 - Agile isn't for everyone. (*Can Agile be used for operations?*)
 - `Agile is about customer-focused`. 

There are 3 must-known terms in `Agile`:
<details>
 <summary>1. Epic</summary> 
 An Epic is a large and high-level piece of work that is too big to be completed in a single iteration (sprint). Epics are often divided into smaller, manageable units like features and user stories. Epics provide a way to capture and organize broader goals or initiatives.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>2. Feature</summary> 
 A Feature is a more detailed and manageable chunk of work that is derived from an Epic. It represents a distinct functionality or capability that adds value to the product. Features are typically broken down further into user stories.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>3. User Story</summary> 
 A User Story is a small, specific requirement that describes a piece of functionality from an end user's perspective. It's typically written in a simple format: "As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit]." User stories help in defining the specifics of what needs to be developed and serve as a basis for prioritization and development within an Agile team.
</details>

In summary, Epics are high-level goals or initiatives, Features are distinct functional chunks derived from Epics, and User Stories are specific requirements from an end user's viewpoint that make up the Features. This hierarchical structure helps Agile teams manage and develop complex projects incrementally and iteratively.

## Common Mistakes in Agile 

The second big mistake that harms the Agile mindset is the challenge of shifting teams' attention from ticketing systems and their associated issues. 

For example, using ticketing systems can be distracting when discussing with customer/user. The conversation often center around breaking down tasks and inputting data, overshadowing the understanding of customer issues/needs. Instead of ***delving into customer problems***, teams get stuck staring at a screen, waiting for data entry. They have extensive discussions about task types, required fields, and acceptance criteria templates. 

As a result, teams focus more on administrative tasks rather than asking the right questions, having valuable discussions, and truly understanding customer needs.

> *Having a problem tracking system with agile project management doesn't make your organization agile.*

Remember, a `user story`:
  - is *NOT a work item*
  - is *NOT a scope of work* 
  - is simply a story: a ***narrative***. 
  - should have the states of work: empathise with user, discussing, doing work, and getting feedback. (not "work in progress", "integration", "testing", "validation")
  - should help us to pay attention to user/customer benefits and increases the emphasis on avoiding unnecessary work.

> *Simply labeling levels in a scope breakdown structure as epics, initiatives, features, or stories does not transform your organization into an agile one.*

### Agile vs ITSM

A very common question is: ITSM is based on a more structured process approach which always categoried as operation guidelines, and agile is categorized as development concept. Can both be mixed?

>  *This question has invariably led to a perception that the two worlds cannot mix. Since Agile espouses methods that are adaptive and people-oriented rather than predictive and process oriented, then the thinking has been that this is counter to ITSM which adopts a more process-centric approach.*

According to [Agile ITSM: How Agile & Service Management Can Work Together](https://www.bmc.com/blogs/agile-service-management/), agile and ITSM have a lot of synergies. Putting the two(2) together can provide value to enterprise.

The article above walk us through the Agile Manifesto, and show us how can the 2 be mixed. Here is the snippet:
  1. We value individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  2. We value working software over comprehensive documentation
  3. We value customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  4. We value responding to change over following a plan

## Challenges in Adopting Agile

> *Why I call it "challenges" instead of "disadvantages"?
> Challenges can be seen as opportunities for growth and improvement, while disadvantages typically represent drawbacks or unfavorable conditions.*

***Agile isn't suitable for everyone; it's meant for those with an open mindset and the courage to embrace change. It's also for those who recognize its challenges and drawbacks, yet are ready to invest effort and resources for growth and improvement.***

<details><summary>1. Resource Planning Uncertainty</summary> Agile's dynamic nature makes early resource planning challenging, especially for larger projects.
  </details>

<details><summary>2. Documentation and Detail</summary> Agile's "just-in-time" approach to documentation can lead to less detailed records.
  </details>

<details><summary>3. Fragmented Product Development</summary> Incremental delivery can result in fragmented products rather than cohesive outputs.
  </details>

<details><summary>4. Continuous Development without Clear Endpoint</summary> Agile's adaptable planning can lead to ongoing feature additions without a definite project endpoint.
  </details>

<details><summary>5. Management Alignment</summary> Gaining full management support for Agile principles and changes can be difficult.
  </details>

<details><summary>6. Testing and Quality Assurance</summary> Agile's continuous testing demands effective coordination and clear criteria.
  </details>

<details><summary>7. Team Ownership and Cultural Shift</summary> Instilling self-ownership and Agile principles across teams requires overcoming resistance and promoting collaboration.
  </details>

<details><summary>8. Financial and Performance Challenges</summary> Aligning Agile's adaptable approach with traditional financial planning and addressing performance issues can pose difficulties.
  </details>

> My last note: The last mistake to avoid before starting Agile 
> *Transitioning to Agile from non-Agile methods can be challenging due to ingrained habits, but awareness of these common obstacles empowers effective resolution and enhances the implementation of Agile methodology.*

In conclusion, prior knowledge of these prevalent challenges can facilitate their effective resolution, thereby will enhance the implementation of the Agile methodology and increase the chance to be success.
