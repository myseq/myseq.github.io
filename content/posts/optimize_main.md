*It is recommended to optimize our `main.py` before sending for* ***static code analysis.***

## Optimization

`Code Optimization` is a practice to make the code more efficient, use less resources while producing the right results.

It has the benefits of:

 - Speed up the app performance
 - Make the code cleaner and readable
 - Simplify for error tracking and debugging
 - Save computational power

Many tools are created to help Python developer to optimize the code.
For the most optimum result, simply combine the tools by chaining them.

Here, I just share a few tools that help in highlighting any <c2>Unused Imports</c2>:

 1. flake8 - To detect unused imports.
 1. autoflake - To remove unused imports.
 1. isort - To sort and organize imports.
 1. pylint - To analyze code for other issues, including unused imports.

Use these tools together can keep the `main.py` cleaner, optimized, and free of unnecessary imports.

### Use flake8

`flake8` is a popular tool for checking Python code style and errors. 
With the `flake8-unused-import` plugin, we can detect unnecessary imports.

First, is to install `flake8`.

```console
$ pip install flake8
```

Then, just run the tool with:

```console
$ flake8 main.py
main.py:4:1: F401 'sys' imported but unused
```

### Use autoflake

`autoflake` is a great tool to remove unused imports and variables automatically.

First, is to install `autoflake`.

```console
$ pip install autoflake
```

And, run `autoflake` to check and fix unused imports in `main2.py`:

```console
$ autoflake --check main2.py
$ autoflake --remove-unused-variables --remove-all-unused-imports --in-place main2.py
```

### Use isort

`isort` is a tool that sorts and organizes imports to follow best practices.
It can:
 - remove duplicate imports.
 - group standard library, third-party, and local imports.
 - ensure consistent import order.

Simply, install and run it with:

```console
$ pip install isort
$ isort main3.py
```

### Use pylint

`pylint` is a comprehensive static code analysis tool that also detects unused imports.

First, install `pylint`.

```console
$ pip install pylint
```

Then, run `pylint` and looks for `unused-import` warnings in the output.

```console
$ pylint main3.py | grep unused
main3.py:4:0: W0611: Unused import sys (unused-import)
```

## Optimum Results

For best results, simply chains the commands together:

```console
$ autoflake --remove-all-unused-imports --in-place main4.py && isort main4.py && pylint main4.py
```
