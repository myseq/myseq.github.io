## 20th Anniversary

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) was officially established on May 5, 2003, with a mission to connect professionals across the globe to help create an economic possibility for a successful and constructive business opportunity.


## LinkedIn

According to [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/), it is the largest professional network on the internet.
LinkedIn users can use it to find the right job or internship, connect and strengthen professional relationships, and learn the skills needed to succeed in career.

> While LinkedIn offers immense opportunities for networking and career development, it is essential to recognize it could be double-edged sword due to its constant exposure to other's achievements.

> And nowadays, I just see it as a strange place where everyone is celebrating something in LinkedIn everyday instead of sharing any professional work.
