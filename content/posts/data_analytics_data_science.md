Data science and data analytics. Are they the same thing?
{{< /lead >}}

While these terms are often used interchangeably, they have different focuses. 

`Data science` is presented as an overarching umbrella term that includes tasks like finding patterns, training machine learning models, and deploying AI applications. 

`Data analytics`, on the other hand, is portrayed as a specialization of data science, concentrating on querying, interpreting, and visualizing datasets.

The data science lifecycle is outlined with seven phases: identifying a problem or opportunity, data mining, data cleaning, data exploration analysis, feature engineering, predictive modeling, and data visualization. The role of a data scientist is highlighted as in-demand, requiring skills in machine learning, AI, coding (Python and R), big data platforms, and database knowledge.

Data analytics is described as the job of conceptualizing existing datasets for decision-making. Four ways to conceptualize data are presented: predictive analytics, prescriptive analytics, diagnostic analytics, and descriptive analytics. The skills required for a data analyst include analytical and programming skills, familiarity with databases, statistical analysis, and data visualization.


## Summary

|      | Data Science | Data Analytic |
| ---- | :----------- | :------------ | 
| Roles | Data Scientist | Data Analyst | 
| Skills | Machine learning, AI, programming languages (Python, R), big data platforms (Hadoop, Apache Spark), database knowledge (SQL) | Data wrangling including Analytical skills, programming skills, statistical analysis, data visualization | 
| Process | 7 phases | 4 types |
| Tools | Python, R, SAS | Excel, Tableau, Power BI | 
| Goals | *To forecast and predict based on the extracted knowledge and insights.* | *To make decisions based on the data collected and analyzed.* |
| Objectives | *To develop algorithms and models that can be used to predict or forecast future outcomes and behaviors.* | *To use statistical tools and techniques to interpret existing data and offer actionable insights.* |
| Application | Forecasting, predictive modeling, anomaly detection, fraud detection, image recognition, natural language processing | Business intelligence, market research, customer analytics, risk assessment, supply chain management |


In summary, `data science` involves the entire data lifecycle, including creating new algorithms, while `data analytics` is more focused on using statistical tools to interpret existing data. 

Both roles are valuable, and the distinction is essential for those considering a career in either field.
