Passkeys are easy to set up and let you securely sign in to your Google Account using your fingerprint, face, screen lock, or hardware security key. You can create a passkey on this device, or use another device.

## Compatibility of WebAuthn

## Types of Passkeys

 1. Cloud-synced Passkey
 2. Single device Passkey



## Best Practices

 - Create a second set of `passkey` as backup. (Meaning to setup a passkey with another device).
