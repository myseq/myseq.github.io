The <mark>World Firefox Day</mark> was first celebrated on `15th July 2006`.

On `17th June 2008`, *[Firefox 3](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/kicking-off-firefox-3-download-day-with-a-boom/) set a Guinness World Record* for the **largest number of software downloads**. 
Within 24 hours, the browser was downloaded more than ***8 million times***. 
And that is time I [downloaded my first Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/download-day-is-here/).
Since then, I'm now a [Firefox](/firefox/) users.

So, today, it marks as the **15th anniversary** since my first use Firefox.
