There is an ***emergency restart*** option hidden in Windows OS.
To activate it:

 - Press `ctrl`+`alt`+`del` buttons.
 - On the new sceen, hold down `ctrl` while click at the `⏻` (power) icon (at the bottom right). 
 - This bring will bring up the `Emergency restart` option.

This might come in handy if you don't have access to the power button for some reasons. 

> This is a slightly better option than forcing a hard shutdown by pressing the power reset button.
