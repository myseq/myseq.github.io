## Font Proofing

MySeq site has selected [Fira Code](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fira+Code) font as the main font since day-1.
The main reason is ***<mark style="color:#FFBF00;background:#303030">Font Proofing</mark>***.

`Font Proofing` is the process of ensuring a font displays correctly and consistently across any various platform.
It involves checking for technical issues that might affect readability or cause confusion.

## Fira Code

`Fira Code` has been a popular choice for programmers due to its focus on readability and functionality. 
These are the important aspectes considered during `font proofing`.

There are 5 groups of character/number that I checked for ***"font-proofed"*** every time.

 1. **Lowercase o (o), uppercase O (O), and number 0 (0):** These can be tricky to tell apart, especially in fonts with a round or loopy design.
 1. **Lowercase l (l), uppercase L (L), and number 1 (1):** Similar to your original question, some fonts might not have clear distinctions between these, particularly for the lowercase L and number 1.
 1. **Lowercase b (b), number 6 (6), and sometimes uppercase B (B):** In some fonts with a closed top on the lowercase b, it can be confused with a number 6. Additionally, some script fonts might have a B that looks similar to a lowercase b.
 1. **Uppercase B (B) and number 8 (8):** This confusion is less common but can happen in certain fonts where the B doesn't have a clear distinction between its two loops.
 1. **Lowercase g (g) and number 9 (9):** Fonts with a closed tail on the lowercase g can be mistaken for a number 9.

### Demo 

Here is the demo of `Fira Code` for the 5 groups above.

|             | UpperCase | LowerCase | Number |
| :---------- | :-------: | :-------: | :----: |
| **Group 1** | O | o | 0 |
| **Group 2** | I | l | 1 |
| Group 3     | B | b | 6 |
| Group 4     | B |   | 8 |
| Group 5     |   | g | 9 |
