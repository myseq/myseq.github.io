Today, I (accidentally) found a way to launch old Windows Explorer on a Windows 11 OS.
{{< /lead >}}

## Good News

First, the good news is the old Windows 10 Explorer isn't removed or replaced by new one in Windows 11.

In case you are like me, who prefer the details pane in old Windows Explorer (in Windows 10) to the new Windows Explorer (in Windows 11), here is a quick way:

 - Open the "Control Panel", just `win+R`, and type `control`.
 - Click the `up arrow` :arrow_up: (beside the address bar) a couple of times. 
 - ***You get the Windows 10 Explorer back***.

In my opinion, the Windows 10 Explorer has better performance over the new one. 

> FYI, it is still possible if you still miss or like to try [using MS Internet Explorer](https://myseq.blogspot.com/2022/08/start-msie-browser-even-replaced-by-ms.html) in Windows 11. 

## Another Way

Later, I found [OldExplorer](https://lesferch.github.io/OldExplorer/) which ia a better solution. 

It can:

 - Setup a preferred starting folder.
 - Access to the old details pane.  

> You can make the Windows 10 Explorer the default file manager in Windows 11 with [SwitchExplorer](https://lesferch.github.io/SwitchExplorer/).
