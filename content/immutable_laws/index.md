## Immutable Laws of Security

The `10 Immutable Laws of Security` was first published by the Microsoft TechNet in 2000.

At that time, there is a screen saver releasedi (in 2001) for it:
 - `Law #1`: *If a bad guy can persuade you to run his program on your computer, it’s not your computer anymore*
 - `Law #2`: *If a bad guy can alter the operating system on your computer, it’s not your computer anymore*
 - `Law #3`: *If a bad guy has unrestricted physical access to your computer, it’s not your computer anymore*
 - `Law #4`: *If you allow a bad guy to upload programs to your website, it’s not your website any more*
 - `Law #5`: *Weak passwords trump strong security*
 - `Law #6`: *A computer is only as secure as the administrator is trustworthy*
 - `Law #7`: *Encrypted data is only as secure as the decryption key*
 - `Law #8`: *An out of date virus scanner is only marginally better than no virus scanner at all*
 - `Law #9`: *Absolute anonymity isn’t practical, in real life or on the Web*
 - `Law #10`: *Technology is not a panacea*


Below is the version 2.0 (released in Aug 2, 2017) and it is maintained by Microsoft Security Response Center:

 - `Law #1`: **If a bad actor can persuade you to run their program on your computer, it's not solely your computer anymore.**
 - `Law #2`: **If a bad actor can alter the operating system on your computer, it's not your computer anymore.**
 - `Law #3`: **If a bad actor has unrestricted physical access to your computer, it's not your computer anymore.**
 - `Law #4`: **If you allow a bad actor to run active content in your website, it's not your website anymore.**
 - `Law #5`: **Weak passwords trump strong security.**
 - `Law #6`: **A computer is only as secure as the administrator is trustworthy.**
 - `Law #7`: **Encrypted data is only as secure as its decryption key.**
 - `Law #8`: **An out-of-date antimalware scanner is only marginally better than no scanner at all.**
 - `Law #9`: **Absolute anonymity isn't practically achievable, online or offline.**
 - `Law #10`: **Technology isn't a panacea.**
