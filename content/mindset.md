The architect has been doing their work from a ***whiteboard***, whilst the engineer doing their work from a ***keyboard***.

There is difference between normal **IT architect** and **cybersecurity architect**. The normal architect thinks about *how a system will work together*, whilst the cybersecurity architect thinks about **how it will fail**.

> *The cybersecurity architect has to first understand how the system is going to work, or they won't know how it might fail.*
>
> *They must have that level of understanding, then have to add on to it: what could be possible things that it could go wrong.*
