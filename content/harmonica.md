The harmonica is a versatile instrument used in various music genres, including blues, folk, rock, and more. It is known for its compact size, making it portable and easy to carry around. 

## The 3 Types of Harmonica


 1. 1-hole diatonic harmonica
 2. Chromatic harmonica
 3. Tremolo harmonica

> ***"10-hole harp"*** **（10孔竖琴）**: It is a colloquial term often used to refer to the harmonica, a small wind instrument that is played by blowing air through it. 
>
>> The harmonica typically has ten holes in which the player can blow or draw (inhale/exhale) air to produce different musical notes.

### The Diatonic Harmonica

The 10-hole design is one of the most common configurations for diatonic harmonicas, which are designed to play in a particular key or musical scale. 
Players can achieve different notes by using their breath and changing the way they interact with the holes, creating a distinctive and recognizable sound.

***The Pros***:
 - It is the only harmonica on which you can achieve the most expressive bending of notes.
 - It is compact and durable compared to most musical instruments.
 - It is inexpensive and easy to play.

***The Cons***:
 - There are *missing notes* or some melodies can't be played.
 - It supports single key only.
 - It requires different pattern of playing notes in each octave.

### Chromatic harmonica

**Chromatic harmonicas** are much bigger than diatonic harmonicas, because it is actually a C harmonica and a C# harmonica wrapped up into one big fat harmonica! 

It has a spring-loaded button on the side. 
Playing with the button released is playing the C harmonica, and playing with the button in is playing the C# harmonica.

It comes with many versions, but the 12-hole chromatic harmonica is by far the most common. The 12-Hole covers 3 octaves, and produces 48 tones.

***The Pros***:
 - Better suited for Jazz.
 - Full access to all 12 notes per octave.
 - All notes are accessed in same pattern across the whole harmonica.
 - Play in any key with just 1 harmonica.

***The Cons***:
 - More difficult to learn.
 - Easy to play “wrong” notes.
 - Very Expensive!

### Tremolo harmonica

The concept of the **tremolo harmonica** is to have two reeds vibrate on every note instead of just one. 
This concept is similar to that of the accordion

> Playing a note on either the diatonic or the chromatic harmonica causes a single metal reed to vibrate in the player’s breath. 

***The Pros***:
 - Popular in early to mid-1900's
 - Cool beating sound from doubling reeds.
 - Tone more like an accordion.
 - Popular in east Asia.

***The Cons***:
 - More airflow required to play.
 - More confusing to learn.
 - More refined technique isolating single reed to bend notes.
 - Unsuitable for playing the blues.
