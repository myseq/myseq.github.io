I write about *Cybersecurity* in **simple practical** terms.

## The Strategies

{{< lead >}}
*Building a Resilient Website with Cybersecurity Key Principles.* 
{{< /lead >}}

Securing your website begins with <c2>essential security practices</c2>. 
These include using strong passwords, enabling SSL/TLS encryption, and keeping your software up to date. 
These steps are non-negotiable to safeguard any site from common threats.

Itâ€™s also important to adopt principles like <c2>security through obscurity, not security by obscurity</c2>. 
The first *uses clever design and techniques* to add extra protection, while the second depends entirely on keeping details hiddenâ€”which is risky if those details are ever discovered. 

> While adding layers of complexity can enhance protection, relying solely on secrecy is risky if those hidden details are ever discovered. 

<c2>Simplifying cybersecurity</c2> is another key approach â€” overcomplicated defenses can lead to mistakes and vulnerabilities. 
Following the <c2>Ten Immutable Laws of Security</c2> helps us focus on the most critical truths, such as the importance of controlling physical and remote access to your systems. 

> For example, if someone has unrestricted access to your systems â€”- whether physically or remotely â€”- your defenses wonâ€™t hold up. 

By sticking to these ***strategies***, focusing on the essentials, and simplifying the approachs, we can create a website that is better protected against todayâ€™s threats.

## Tools Development

All tools and utils that developed are stored at `myseq`@[github](https://github.com/myseq/).

### Utils â‰  Tools

Utility is not same as tool. Utilities are small program that brings fun and quick solution to some problems. I've put all the utilities that I created at GitHub repo at [MySeq/utils](https://github.com/myseq/utils):
