As a **[Cybersecurity strategist](/mindset/)**, I responsible for designing and implementing security solutions, managing risks, and fostering a strong security culture within the organization I work for. 
This includes <i><b><mark style="color:#8080FF;background:#303030">security strategy development, threat management, risk assessment and management, security architecture design, and security standards and compliance.</mark></b></i>

I'm also a **[cmdline geek](/tags/cli/)**, and spends most of my time in learning things, such as: - *Network security (TCP/IP), Coding (Android apps, Python/Ruby, Markdown), Clouds (Google/Azure/AWS), Containers (Kubernetes/docker, LCX), IoT (ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi), vim and zsh/bash*.

Besides that, I've ***[always been fascinated by how I could make a program (or a piece of code) runs more efficiently](/tags/async/)*** or how I could organize the code so it is easy to change.

## ♫ ♪ 𝄞⨾𓍢ִ໋

I'm a person who like Celtic music and Acoustic songs, with in occasion I like to listen to Bossa Nova (🍷) too. 

According to Gemini, I'm the type of person who is:

 - **Open-minded and appreciative of diverse sounds**  
 > I enjoy music from different cultures and eras, suggesting a willingness to explore beyond familiar genres. 
 > Celtic music with its roots in folklore and storytelling, the cool sophistication of Bossa Nova, and the intimacy of acoustic songs all represent distinct styles.

 - **Drawn to melody and emotion**  
 > My interest in Celtic and acoustic music suggests an appreciation for beautiful melodies and a focus on emotional expression.  
 > Bossa Nova, while often laid-back, can also be quite lyrical and evoke a certain mood.

 - **Relaxed and easygoing** 
 > The calming nature of Bossa Nova and the often folky or introspective qualities of Celtic music and acoustic songs hint at a preference for music that creates a mellow atmosphere.

 - **Appreciative of tradition and history** 
 > Celtic music in particular is steeped in tradition.
 > My enjoyment of it could indicate an interest in cultural heritage and stories from the past.

 - **Creative or introspective** 
 > Acoustic music often lends itself to a more personal listening experience. 
 > I might find acoustic songs to be a good outlet for reflection or inspiration.

I have 2 favorite singers: ***Beyond and Zard***.
