## About ZD

### 1st-Half :t-rex:

> <i><b><mark style="color:#FFBF00;background:#303030">Knowledge is Power.</mark></b></i> :t-rex:

As a **[Cybersecurity strategist](/mindset/)**, I responsible for designing and implementing security solutions, managing risks, and fostering a strong security culture within the organization I work for. 
This includes <i><b><mark style="color:#8080FF;background:#303030">security strategy development, threat management, risk assessment and management, security architecture design, and security standards and compliance.</mark></b></i>

I'm also a **[cmdline geek](/tags/cli/)**, and spends most of my time in learning things, such as: - *Network security (TCP/IP), Coding (Android apps, Python/Ruby, Markdown), Clouds (Google/Azure/AWS), Containers (Kubernetes/docker, LCX), IoT (ESP8266 and Raspberry Pi), vim and zsh/bash*.

Besides that, I've ***[always been fascinated by how I could make a program (or a piece of code) runs more efficiently](/tags/async/)*** or how I could organize the code so it is easy to change.

At my free time ⏳, I would wandering around with my ***motorcycle*** 🏍️; flying my ***Mavic Mini*** 🚁; enjoying my ***drinks*** 🍷 + 🍻, and <i><b><mark style="color:#8080FF;background:#303030">[reading books](https://myseq.github.io/reading/) 📚</mark></b></i>.

Lately, I just bought myself a new toy, <i><b><mark style="color:#7fff00;background:#303030">JIMИY</mark></b></i> (<b><mark style="color:#FFBF00;background:#303030">:jeep:</mark></b>)
