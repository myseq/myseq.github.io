Leaving a high-flying job in consulting, Angela Lee Duckworth took a job teaching math to seventh graders in a New York public school. She quickly realized that IQ wasn't the only thing separating the successful students from those who struggled. Here, she explains her theory of "grit" as a predictor of success.

In a world that often prioritizes IQ and talent, Angela Duckworth, a former teacher turned psychologist, discovered that something else plays a crucial role in determining success: grit. In this blog post, we'll explore the transcript of Angela Duckworth's TED Talk, where she discusses her journey from teaching to researching the importance of grit in various contexts, particularly in education.

## What is Grit?

Grit, as defined by Duckworth, is the combination of passion and perseverance for long-term goals. It's about having the stamina to stay committed to your goals, working hard day in and day out, not just for a short period, but for years. Grit means living life like a marathon, not a sprint. It's a quality that goes beyond traditional measures like IQ, social intelligence, or physical appearance.

## The Discovery of Grit

Duckworth's journey began when she transitioned from a demanding management consulting job to teaching seventh graders math in New York City. She observed that IQ wasn't the sole differentiator between her best and worst students. Some of the brightest kids struggled, while some with average IQs excelled. This realization prompted her to investigate further.

Years of research in challenging settings, including West Point Military Academy, the National Spelling Bee, and underprivileged schools, consistently revealed that grit was a significant predictor of success. Grittier individuals were more likely to persevere and achieve their goals, even when other factors were controlled for.

## Building Grit in Kids

Despite the importance of grit, the question remains: How can we build it in kids? Duckworth acknowledges that there's no easy answer. However, she highlights the concept of "growth mindset" as a promising approach. Developed by Carol Dweck at Stanford University, it teaches kids that their ability to learn isn't fixed and can improve with effort. When children believe that failure isn't permanent, they are more likely to persevere.

But Duckworth emphasizes the need for more research and ideas to effectively nurture grit in children. We must be willing to test our best ideas, measure their success, and be prepared to adapt and learn from our failures.

## Conclusion: Let's Get Gritty

In the world of education, it's clear that IQ and talent alone aren't sufficient for success. Grit, that combination of passion and perseverance for long-term goals, plays a crucial role. To empower our children with grit, we must continue our efforts to explore and develop effective strategies. It's time to be gritty about making our kids grittier.

In summary, grit is the secret ingredient that sets apart successful individuals, and though the path to building it may not be entirely clear, it's a journey worth embarking upon for the betterment of our children's future.
