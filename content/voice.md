If sharp criticism disappears completely, mild criticism will become harsh.

If mild criticism is not allowed, silence will be considered ill-intended.

If silence is no longer allowed, complimenting not hard enough is a crime.

If only one-voice is allowed to exist, then the only voice that exists is <mark>a lie</mark>.
