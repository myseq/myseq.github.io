If sharp criticism disappears completely, mild criticism will become harsh.

If mild criticism is not allowed, silence will be considered ill-intended.

If silence is no longer allowed, complimenting not hard enough is a crime.

If only one-voice is allowed to exist, then *the only voice that exists is <mark style="color:#7FFF00;background:#303030">a lie</mark>*.
